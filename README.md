## Our Mission

**Girls Who Code was founded with a single mission:

to close the gender gap in technology**

### Why It Matters

Computing is where the jobs are â€” and where they will be in the future, but fewer than 1 in 5 computer science graduates are women.

### Jax Makerspace Chapter of Girls Who Code

Want to work at a tech company?

Get your start with a Girls Who Code Club!

This site was built to display club information, lecture notes and resources via github pages.
